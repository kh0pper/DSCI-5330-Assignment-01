## NORTH AMERICAN EXPANSION OPPORTUNITY

### Current Situation: Massive Untapped Potential

North America represents our **largest growth opportunity**:
- Current revenue: **$0.39B annually (2.2% of total)**
- Market size: **$23 trillion GDP** (USA + Canada)
- Benchmark: Europe generates **$4.5B annually** in a smaller economy

For context, we have stronger market share in Sub-Saharan Africa (26.2%) than in the world's largest consumer market. This imbalance presents extraordinary growth potential.

### Revenue Forecast Scenarios
